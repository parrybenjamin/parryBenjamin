			<h1>Benjamin Parry</h1>
			<h2>About me and this site</h2>

			<p>Hello! My name is Benjamin Parry, I am currently a rising senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying East Asian Languages and Civilizations. I believe that both broad and masterful erudition is one of the greatest joys of life and I am fascinated by learning new things, particulairily skills. This site is something I built in my spare time as part of exploring that path. </p> 

			<p>There are countless other skills that I wish to learn but the ones that are at present the biggest part of my life are: Chinese(Mandarin) as a second language, gymnastics, running, cooking, reading extensively and deeply and living more presently in every moment(as I see it as the only way to truly make the most of life). If you want to see more of my prescence on the internet to know more about what I do then follow the links below.</p>

			<p>If you would like to get in touch with me then just shoot me an email:</p>
